# Project Screenshots Repository

This repository contains optimized screenshots for my projects, skills, and about section, organized and prepared for use in my portfolio website integrated with Firebase.

## Repository Structure
- `/projects/optimized/`: Contains optimized screenshots of various web projects and applications.
- `/skills/optimized/`: (Optional) Will contain optimized icons or images representing my skills.
- `/about/optimized/`: (Optional) Will contain optimized images for the about section (e.g., profile photo).

## What I Did
- **Captured Screenshots**: Took high-quality screenshots for each project (e.g., `age-calculator.png`, `hepta.png`, etc.).
- **Optimized Images**: Used **Squoosh** to compress the images, converting them to **WebP** format with a quality setting of 75-85% to reduce file size while maintaining clarity.
- **Organized Files**: Stored all optimized images in the `optimized` folder under respective categories (currently under `projects/optimized/`).
- **Uploaded to GitHub**: Uploaded the optimized images to this private repository for secure storage and easy access.
- **Prepared for Firebase**: The images are ready to be linked in my Firebase database using raw URLs from GitHub for display on my website.

## Image Details
- **Format**: All images are in **WebP** format for better performance.
- **Naming Convention**: Each image is named after its corresponding project (e.g., `age-calculator.webp`, `bankist-app.webp`).
- **Usage**: These screenshots are intended for my portfolio website, showcasing project interfaces and designs.

## Notes
- This repository is set to **private** to protect my work.
- To access the images programmatically (e.g., in Firebase), a **Personal Access Token** may be required in the URL for authentication.
- Original (unoptimized) images are stored locally as a backup and not included here to save space.

## Future Plans
- Add `skills/optimized/` and `about/optimized/` folders as needed.
- Update screenshots if project designs change.
- Consider using Git LFS if the number of images increases significantly.
